This project is meant to reflect the environment to the blind people through audio ,
so that they can recognize the object which is placed in-front of them and 
they can be intimated through audio with objects name this could really help a blind man to live a without others help.

If you need to process your image 
then, first run pi_object_detection program after that run real time object detection program 
and with this I have attached some audio files so that you can get to know about the project  in the correct perspective.
